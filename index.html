            <p>
                Hello, I am an experienced Software Engineer with a demonstrated history of working in MNC as well as academic envvironments. I have done my Bachelor in Engineering from MIT College of Engineering, Pune and I am currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science and Engineering from Santa Clara University. 
            </p>
           <p>I am an extremely passionate and a competitive person who measures growth in terms of what I don’t know. For me progress is when my tomorrow has one less thing that I didn’t know as compared to today. This keeps my hunger to learn more and helps me achieve my targets. When working in the team I understand the importance of responsibility, and I strive hard to ensure that work is complete. I am a proactive person who will look for the next task. I also like to understand the bigger picture and I am not afraid to ask questions wherever I find necessary. 
            I am not afraid to work out of my comfort zone and try out new things.   My current role as Research Assistant, required me learn everything from scratch, including reading of a CT image.
            </p>
            <p>Also,I am easily approachable which helps me assimilate easily in any team. I am fun loving person who brings positivity in the team and I can push anyone to work harder. With my leadership skills and responsible attitude, I am as good a leader as a follower. In my previous company I was assigned to be the process head for the team and people with more experience also respected my work. </p>
            <p>My hardworking and competitive attitude helps me to be better than most of my peers, and my All-India rank of 190/150,000 students in the All India Common Entrance Test is a testament to this fact</p>
